Proteins are made from ribosome with mRNA. An mRNA is produced from DNA. 
Proteins contains amino acids. Each amino acid is made of 3 nucleotides.
Also, first amino acid of a protein is always Metionin(AUG) and last amino acid of a protein is always one of stop codons (UAA/UAG/UGA).
In this assignment, we will use multi dimensional arrays to represent nucleotide sequence of a mRNA.
We will produce a protein (amino acid sequence) from these mRNA and identify this protein.
