My first java program! In this program, i learned how to write an object oriented program.  
We have "Member","SportCenter","Main" classes. We create Objects from these classes with constructors. We access attributes of these objects with getter/setter methods.  
In Main class, program waits a command from user, user can;  
1- add new members (Member Objects),  
2- display all members in our sports center (SportCenter Object),  
3- calculates Body Mass Index of a specific member,  
4- exits the program.  
Body Mass Index (BMI) = Weight / (Height^2) = kg / (m^2)
