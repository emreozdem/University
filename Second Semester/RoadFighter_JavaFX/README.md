My first GUI! I made a old atari game named "Road Fighter" with JavaFX library.  
In this game, our goal is score points as much as possible.  
When user's car overtaken a competitor's car, Score increases depending on level. Higher levels means higher increase.  
If user overtake [4 + (current_level * 2)] competitors, level increases by 1.  
User can control his/her car with keyboard arrows. If user's car 'touches' on other cars, game overs(print score to screen).  
Player can restart the game by pressing ENTER.  
User's car is red car. Other cars are yellow. Overtaken cars will be green. You can steer into front of overtaken cars.  
Car's speed will increase depending on level.
