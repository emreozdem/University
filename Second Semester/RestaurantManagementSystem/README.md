In this project, i learned Classes, objects, encapsulation and inheritance.  
This program is an Restaurant Managament System. There are classes in this project as Item, Order, Table and Worker. I used this classes to create objects.  
Firstly, initialization part, program reads a file named "setup.dat" for creating our restaurant. You can find details of initialization commands on pdf file.  
We created and initialized our restaurant. Now, we have lots of commands to run our restaurant. Program reads a file named "commands.dat" and process these commands. You can find details of all commands in pdf file.  
In the future, i am planning to do an GUI and some updates on this code. I will do a better project.
