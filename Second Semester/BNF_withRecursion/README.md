In this project, i got familiar with Java Collections and Recursions. Our program will handle Backus-Naur Form(BNF).  
This program, takes an input file named "BNF.dat". In this file, there are non-terminal symbols with its expansion to terminal symbols on each line.  
Our goal in this program is reading this file, storing this data in an ArrayList, expanding it until all symbols are terminal with recursion.
