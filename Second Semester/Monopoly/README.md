In this program, i got familiar with inheritance, polymorphism and JSON format.  
This program is basically a monopoly game.  
Firstly, program fetches properties and cards from JSON formatted files. We store this data in a array of objects.  
Then, program reads a file named "commands". This file consists of a player name followed by rolled dice.
Program processes these commands and plays this game. When "show()" command is read, prints details of game like players' money and properties.  
There are many rules in monopoly game. Rules are stated in pdf file.  
Also, added "jsonsimple.jar" library.
